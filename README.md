# NextCloudCookbookToCooklang
A utility to convert NextCloud Cookbook JSON files to Cooklang format.

# Why?
Mostly a personal project for my own use case. I have hundreds of recipes collected over the years in[ NextCloud Cookbook](https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook) format (JSON document with custom schema) but I prefer the Markdown like format of [CookLang](https://cooklang.org/). Cooklang syntax is very easy to visually read and share for non-technical users (compared to JSON) and it is easier to edit plain text files from any device.

# Project Status
The project is not yet started and it is going to be alpha quality for a long time. Sorry I don't have more time for dev work!
